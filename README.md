##Slide 1
Hello, my name is Dima. 
Today we talk about history HTML CSS 
##Slide 2
With the advent of computers, there was a desire and need to somehow unite them, 
and 4 major universities in the United States took on this task. About 7 years have 
passed from the creation of the concept to the historical moment
The history of markup languages goes back to the 1960s, when IBM employees took on 
the task of transferring documents between different platforms and operating systems. 
The result of their efforts was the language General Markup Language (SGML), which 
was intended for use on computers of the IBM family.
This powerful markup language was used by the US military for technical documentation. 
SGML was not widely used because it was difficult and expensive to implement.
For a long time, the Internet was intended only for specialists and served mainly for 
the exchange of technical documentation and emails. There was nothing for the simple 
user to do there. And only at the beginning of the 90s of the last century did the 
revolution "Internet people!"
##Slide 3
In the late 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee (a CERN employee at the European Center for Nuclear 
Research) addressed the issue of storing and displaying data. The problem was that each 
specialist who came to the Center applied his own methods of presenting information, and 
it was necessary to create a universal system that would not depend on the computer platform used and was simple.
Tim Berners-Lee laid the SGML language and techniques for working with hypertext as 
the basis for the language being developed.
##Slide 4
The first website in the world was also created by Tim Berners-Lee And if the exact 
date of the invention of HTML is not known (because it was a long-term project), then 
the birthday of the first site is very much - it was August 6, 1991. By the way, it can 
be seen today, though already in the archive.
##Slide 5
The first HTML documents contained about 40 tags. These were text pages only.  3 tags 
appeared that served to visualize the document (for example, bold italics). The rest of 
the tags served exclusively for logical markup
Slide 6
HTML 2.0 was developed in 1995 and was not significantly different from version 1.0.
HTML 3.0 included many new features:
Creating tables, displaying mathematical formulas; support for gif format, text wrapping, etc.
##Slide 7
When creating HTML 3.0, developers thought about how to improve the look and feel of a 
web page. And the creators of the third version decided to add to it the support of a new 
tool that served for the design of web pages.
Using CSS, a web page creator could easily change the font and size of anything, and what's 
important is that it became possible not by introducing new tags, but by using a mechanism 
that influenced existing HTML tags.
So, CSS system:
does not depend on HTML,
it has her own syntax
allows you to set parameters for any HTML tag.
##Slide 8
In 1997, HTML 4 was adopted.
There has been some “cleaning” of the standard. Many items have been marked as obsolete and 
not recommended.
In particular, the font element used to change font properties has been marked obsolete 
(it is recommended to use CSS style sheets instead).
Also, this version is universal (supported on any browsers and any operating systems).
##Slide 9
In 2014, HTML5 is officially recommended.
HTML 5.0 contains CSS3 and WEB 2.0 markup languages.
HTML5 is not a follower of the hypertext markup language, but a new open platform designed 
to create web applications that use audio, video, graphics, animation, and more.
The new version has made the syntax more stringent than the previous one. Multimedia technology support improved. 
28 new structural elements appeared, thanks to which the code became more understandable 
Removed part of obsolete tags It has become more attention paid to the support of scripts, for example javascript 
At the moment, the development of HTML continues .
##Slide 10
Today that all, thank you.
